Android Project
I have previously written an android barcode scanner that utilised the zxing toolkit. As part of that project I made a library for working with ISBNs including getting details of the book from https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:<ISBN>. Notable changes here are that I now support scanning QR Codes, it has a modern android project structure. I've cut out a lot of unecessary source files as the project was also doing other things. I also just use the .jar generated from the ISBN library. You can view the previous work at https://github.com/AvengingSyndrome/Barcode-Scanner  You will note I haven't worked on it in years and some bug fixes for the current android runtime existed that i had to fix.

The core idea of this project is to push as much work to the html files that the webview vists. We provide native functionality through a javascript interface. The files we use are available from the main haskell project at static/add_a_book_m.html, static/return_book_m.html, static/rent_a_book.html. You can see calls to Android.scanText() and Android.scanSomething(). Android.scanSomething is the barcode scanner and Android.scanText is the qr code scanner.
